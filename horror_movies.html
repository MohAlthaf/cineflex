				<h1>Horror Cinema</h1>
				<p style="color: white;">English horror movies have a rich history dating back to the early 1900s. One of the first notable films was "The Cabinet of Dr. 
                    Caligari" (1920), a German expressionist film that heavily influenced the genre. However, it was in the 1950s and 60s that English horror films really took 
                    off with the rise of Hammer Films. These films often starred Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and focused on gothic themes and monsters such as 
                    vampires, werewolves, and mummies.</p><br>
                <p style="color: white;">In the 1970s, English horror films shifted to a more psychological and realistic approach with films such as "The Wicker Man" 
                    (1973) and "The Exorcist" (1973). These films explored themes of religion, morality, and societal fears, setting the tone for horror films in the years to 
                    come.</p><br>
                <p style="color: white;">The 1980s and 90s brought about a wave of slasher films, with franchises such as "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" dominating 
                    the genre. However, there were also notable English horror films such as "Hellraiser" (1987) and "Candyman" (1992) that brought a fresh take on horror
                     with unique villains and themes.</p><br>
                <p style="color: white;">In recent years, English horror films have seen a resurgence with films such as "The Witch" (2015) and "Hereditary" (2018) 
                    that blend psychological horror with supernatural elements. Overall, English horror films have played an important role in the genre, influencing and 
                    shaping horror films around the world.</p><br>
